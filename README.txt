<h2>Introduction</h2>

Welcome to the Self-Learning Programming Progress Tracker!<br>  
<br> 
üöÄ This repository serves as a personal log of my journey in learning programming languages independently.
<br> 
Through this project, I aim to document my progress, showcase the skills I have acquired, and provide insights into the projects I have completed.

<h2>Motivation</h2>

The motivation behind this project is to demonstrate my dedication and passion for programming.<br>
üí™ By embarking on this self-learning journey, I have honed my skills in various programming languages and technologies. 
Through continuous learning, practice, and hands-on projects, I have deepened my understanding and expertise in the world of programming.

<h2>Project Structure</h2>

The repository is organized into the following directories:

<h3>üìö #00 Programming Languages</h3>

Contains subdirectories for each programming language I have learned, where you can find code snippets, exercises, and small projects demonstrating my proficiency in that particular language. Some of the languages I have acquired proficiency in include but are not limited to Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and HTML/CSS. Each language directory within this repository provides examples and projects that demonstrate my knowledge and skills in that particular language.

<h3>üí° #00 Projects</h3>

Includes subdirectories for different projects I have completed, showcasing my ability to solve problems and create functional applications using various programming languages. Throughout my journey, I have undertaken several hands-on projects, ranging from small utilities and web applications to more complex algorithms and data structure implementations. The Projects directory includes a detailed description of each project, its purpose, and the technologies employed.

<h3>üìñ #00 Resources</h3>

Contains useful resources, tutorials, and reference materials I have utilized during my learning journey.

<h3>‚≠ê #00 Progress Highlights</h3>

Here are some of the key highlights of my self-learning programming journey:

<h3>üå± #00 Learning Process</h3>

I believe in continuous learning and improving my skills. üéØ I have consistently sought out resources, online courses, and programming challenges to enhance my knowledge and practical abilities. The Resources directory contains a curated list of the materials that have been valuable to my learning journey.
